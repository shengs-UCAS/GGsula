# GGsula
This repository contains a collection of scripts for Genome sequencing and assembly of feral chickens in the wild of Sulawesi, including SNP calling, phylogenetic analysis, admixture analysis, genome assembly, and structural variant (SV) detection. Each script is designed to perform specific tasks in the genomic data analysis workflow.

## Scripts Overview

### 1. SNP Calling.md
The SNP calling script identifies single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from genomic data. It processes raw sequencing data to detect variations at the nucleotide level.

### 2. Phylogenetic Analysis.md
The phylogenetic analysis script constructs phylogenetic trees to infer evolutionary relationships among different species or populations. It uses sequence alignment data to generate tree structures.

### 3. Admixture Analysis.md
The admixture analysis script examines the genetic composition of individuals to identify ancestral populations and estimate the proportion of ancestry from each population. It helps in understanding population structure and gene flow.

### 4. Genome Assembly.md
The genome assembly script assembles short sequencing reads into longer contiguous sequences (contigs) to reconstruct the genome. It is essential for creating reference genomes and studying genomic architecture.

### 5. SV Detection.md
The structural variantions (SVs) detection script identifies large-scale genomic variations, such as insertions, deletions, inversions, and translocations. It provides insights into genomic rearrangements and their potential impact on gene function.
